# Nodebb-Redis-KeyConverter
Convert this mess of data, that redis spits out into usable Json classes


This exe is made for the "json" you get if you use the RedisInsight Server to export all keys to JSON.
The output is a mess, and u cant really work with it.

This converter will pick out all - Users - Posts - Topics - Imported_Users -
and sort them into their own classes ,
Then outputs them to 4 .Json files that u can work with
